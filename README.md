Hello, this series of blog posts originates from my personal enthusiasm for understanding how the world economic system works, and how the cornucopia of welfare is distributed among us â€” the citizens of the Western world.

The themes revolve around how energy, technology, capitalism, and especially the monetary system dynamically intertwine to produce economic outcomes. Last but not least, this is also a personal crusade: how to confront looming climate change and ecological disaster without completely redesigning the capitalist system.

While some might label me a leftist idealist, my concern is rather that capitalism itself may become the driving force against its own survival in a world of rising inequality and injustice.
