# Blog init

Hello, this series of blog posts originates from my personal enthusiasm for understanding how the world economic system works, and how the cornucopia of welfare is distributed among us ‚Äî the citizens of the Western world.

The themes revolve around how energy, technology, capitalism, and especially the monetary system dynamically intertwine to produce economic outcomes. Last but not least, this is also a personal crusade: how to confront looming climate change and ecological disaster without completely redesigning the capitalist system.

While some might label me a leftist idealist, my concern is rather that capitalism itself may become the driving force against its own survival in a world of rising inequality and injustice.

Austerity Politics in Finland 2025 Onward

Today I am reflecting on how Finland‚Äôs government is about to take austerity politics a step further than almost any other Western economy has ever dared.

The Finnish government is preparing legislation to cap the debt-to-GDP ratio at 40%, enforcing yearly reductions until the target is reached. This goes well beyond the Maastricht Treaty‚Äôs 60% guideline for EU member states. At present, Finland‚Äôs debt-to-GDP ratio is about 86%, placing the country roughly in the middle range among European economies.

My personal view on public debt ‚Äî as opposed to private debt, which indeed carries systemic risks ‚Äî is that it is primarily a tool. Public debt is not inherently dangerous; it is a way to mobilize resources and direct them toward achieving the best possible economic outcomes.

I have been developing a village model to explore how the inhabitants of an isolated community might implement an economic system based on a common medium of exchange. While it does *not* mirror the workings of modern economies, I believe this level of abstraction is necessary to uncover the root problems behind austerity and debt-based money thinking ‚Äî **problems that harm not only the poor, but also those who consider themselves established and wealthy**.

### Mahtik√§sky ‚Äî ajatusharjoitelma leikkauspolitiikasta

Kuvittele suljettu kyl√§, jossa on 10 asukasta sek√§ oma kyl√§nvanhin majassaan.Er√§√§n√§ p√§iv√§n√§ kyl√§nvanhin mahtik√§skyll√§ p√§√§tt√§√§, ett√§ t√§st√§ l√§htien kaikki kyl√§ss√§ tapahtuvat vaihdot on teht√§v√§ h√§nen jakamillaan kupongeilla, eik√§ omasta kuormasta saa en√§√§ ottaa.

Kun uudet lait on kirjattu, kyl√§nvanhin jakaa jokaiselle, paitsi itselleen 10 kuponkia, yhteens√§ siis 100.

Er√§s kyl√§l√§isist√§ keksii tavan tuottaa hy√∂dykkeit√§ kaksinkertaisella nopeudella. Muut alkavat ostaa juuri h√§nelt√§, ja kupongit siirtyv√§t lopulta kaikki h√§nen haltuunsa. Rikastuminen motivoi h√§nt√§ jatkamaan, ja h√§n tarvitsee pari aputy√∂miest√§, jotka saavat kuponkeja palkaksi ja k√§ytt√§v√§t niit√§ ostaakseen menestyv√§n kyl√§l√§isen tuotteita.

Yritt√§j√§n ongelmaksi muodostuu pian ostovoiman romahtaminen, sill√§ kyl√§l√§isill√§ ei yksinkertaisesti ole enemp√§√§ kuponkeja k√§ytett√§viss√§√§n. Kyl√§nvanhin implementoi 1/10 verotuksen ja alkaa kierr√§tt√§√§ kuponkeja n√§√§ntyville kyl√§l√§isille, jotta he voivat jatkaa tuotteiden ostamista.

Kaikki hyvin.

Naapurikyl√§ss√§ otetaan samanlainen j√§rjestelm√§ k√§ytt√∂√∂n. Siell√§ kuitenkin keksit√§√§n menetelm√§, joka lis√§√§ tuottavuutta kolminkertaiseksi sill√§ seurauksella, ett√§ kotikyl√§nkin kupongit alkavat virrata naapurikyl√§√§n.

Koska kuponkien m√§√§r√§ omassa kyl√§ss√§ v√§henee, kyl√§nvanhin alkaa luoda niit√§ lis√§√§. H√§n laskee liikkeelle toiset 100 yksikk√∂√§ ja jakaa ne tasaisesti kaikille. Nyt molemmilla kylill√§ on 100 ensimm√§isen kyl√§n kuponkia.

Samaan aikaan toinen kekseli√§s ensimm√§isen kyl√§n yritt√§jist√§ alkaa kilpailla laadulla. H√§nen tuotteensa kelpaa sek√§ oman, ett√§ naapurikyl√§n v√§elle. Nyt molempien kylien kupongit alkavat virrata h√§nen taskuihinsa ja h√§nen tuotteeseensa kohdistuu nyt 200 kupongin arvosta ostovoimaa.

Kaikki on viel√§kin hyvin...

Er√§√§n√§ p√§iv√§n√§ kyl√§nvanhin saa aivot√§r√§hdyksen ja p√§√§tt√§√§, ett√§ nyt kaikki kupongit on ker√§tt√§v√§ ja tuhottava -- vaihtoehtoja ei ole. Niinp√§ h√§n alkaa verotuksen kautta ker√§t√§ oman kyl√§n kuponkeja pois, kunnes oman kyl√§n kuponkien kokonaism√§√§r√§ putoaa nollaan.Kuvitellaan, ett√§ naapurikyl√§√§n j√§i lopputilanteessa viel√§ 10 kuponkia.

1. **Kun austerity on m√§√§r√§tty, miten ja kenelt√§ kupongit otetaan pois?**

2. **Mit√§ tapahtuu oman kyl√§n reaalitaloudelle kun vaihdon v√§line hiljalleen v√§henee ja lopulta sit√§ ei ole en√§√§ lainkaan?**

3. **Kun oman kyl√§n kupongit ovat kaikki tuhottu, mik√§ arvo on niill√§ 10 kupongilla, jotka j√§iv√§t naapurikyl√§n haltuun?**

### The Decree ‚Äî A Thought Experiment on Austerity Politics

Imagine a closed village with ten inhabitants and their elder living in his hut.
One day, by decree, the elder decides that from now on all exchanges within the village must be carried out using coupons distributed by him, and that no one is allowed to take directly from their own stock anymore.

Once the new rules are in place, the elder distributes ten coupons to each villager, except himself ‚Äî one hundred in total.

One of the villagers discovers a way to produce goods at twice the usual speed. The others soon begin buying from him, and eventually all the coupons flow into his hands. His growing wealth motivates him to continue, and he hires a couple of helpers. They receive coupons as wages, which they then spend on purchasing the successful villager‚Äôs goods.

The entrepreneur‚Äôs problem soon becomes a collapse in purchasing power, since the villagers simply have no more coupons to spend. The elder responds by implementing a one-tenth tax and redistributes the collected coupons to the struggling villagers, so that they can continue buying goods.

All is well.

Meanwhile, the neighboring village adopts a similar system. There, however, someone invents a method that triples productivity, with the result that even the home village‚Äôs coupons begin to flow into their hands.

Since the number of coupons in the home village is shrinking, the elder decides to create more. He issues another 100 units and distributes them evenly among the villagers. Now both villages hold 100 of the home village‚Äôs coupons.

At the same time, another inventive entrepreneur from the first village begins to compete on quality. His products appeal not only to his fellow villagers but also to the neighboring community. Soon, coupons from both villages flow into his hands, and demand for his goods now represents purchasing power worth 200 coupons.

All is still well‚Ä¶

Until one day, the village elder suffers a concussion and suddenly decrees that all coupons must be collected and destroyed ‚Äî there are no alternatives. Through taxation he begins to draw in the home village‚Äôs coupons, until their total supply falls all the way to zero.

Let us imagine that, by the end, the neighboring village still holds 10 of those coupons.

1. **When austerity is imposed, how and from whom are the coupons taken away?**

2. **What happens to the real economy of the home village when the medium of exchange gradually diminishes and eventually disappears entirely?**

3. **Once all of the home village‚Äôs coupons have been destroyed, what value remains in the 10 coupons still held by the neighboring village?**
